# Programming-Assignment-3-BU_EC327
These files consist of my Programming Assignment 3 in EC327.  This is a user operated game in C++, which incorporates concepts from
class hierarchies and polymorphism.  The goal of the game is to take your two astronaut objects and successfully charge two space station
objects using moonrocks so that you can take off of the moon before your oxygen is depleted.
